# CS-305-Project-One

**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?**
- Artemis Financial is an international consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for its customers, including savings, retirement, investements, and insurance. They currently have a web-based software application, and want me to identify any security vulnerabilities that could potentially pose a threat to them.

 **What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?** 

- When I found the clients security vulnerabilities within their website, I created a mitigation plan to address each issue throroughly in order to effecively get rid of any potential weaknesses in the software. Coding securely has many benefits for a company, such as preventing data breaches, protecting user data, maintaining repuation, and complying with regulations. Overall, having secure software can lead to a much more positive experience for both the company and it's users.

**Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**

- The most challenging part of the assessment was creating the mitigation plan, because I hadn't seen any of those vulnerabilities before, and so I had to do a lot of research in order to come up with effective solutions that would serve Artemis Financial well.

**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**

- I increased layers of security by implementing encyption into Artemis Financials archive database, and updated the websites frameworks and dependencies to ensure a more secure operation. In the future, I will probably continue to use a dependency check program such as the one used in this project, as it provides a quick and easy way to identify vulnerabilities, and even gives solutions on how to solve them.

**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**

- I made sure the code and software application were secure by running multiple dependency checks to ensure that the vulnerabilities were being solved. Additionally, if I had false-positives showing up again and again, I made sure to suppress them so they wouldn't keep showing up on the reports and confuse the rest of the security team.

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**

- Like I mentioned before, the dependency check was a very useful tool for identifying vulnerabilities and giving solutions on how to solve them. Another resource I would consider using in the future is the OWASP Secure Coding Guide, as it provides plenty of great information on how to secure Java applications.

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**

- I think the best part of this project that I could use to showcase my expertise would have to be understanding and interpreting my clients needs. I think I did a good job of recognizing what Artemis Financial wanted to do and understood the logistics of it, as well as how to implement it into their current application seamlessly.
